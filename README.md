## Exploring the creative potential of p5.js with a playful and experimental approach.


As an artist and coder, my mission is to solve interesting problems, empower others, and build a strong community. p5.js and a healthy dose of vanilla JavaScript allow me to create interactive and weird art. 

The p5.js Guild newsletter delves into the creative potential of p5.js and JavaScript. My goal is to encourage and empower others to have fun and make art with code.
