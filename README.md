# Hi, I'm Jaycee 👋

## Technical Support Specialist | Developer Community Expert | Creative Technologist

I help developers solve complex problems and build thriving communities. By day, I'm a technical support specialist with 700+ accepted solutions in developer communities, specializing in API debugging and user empathy. By night, I'm building an AI home lab and exploring the intersection of analog and digital creativity.

**Currently:**
- 🔧 Technical Product Support at HubSpot (5+ years)
- 🤖 Daily AI user (Claude Pro, Anthropic API) + building AI home lab
- 🎵 Music production blending analog and digital techniques
- 📸 Street photography and graffiti documentation
- 💻 Creative coding and technical experimentation

**My mission:** Solve interesting problems, empower others, and build strong communities—whether through technical support, AI experimentation, or creative expression.

**Recent focus:** Building my professional portfolio, advancing my AI home lab setup, and exploring new opportunities in technical product support and developer advocacy.
