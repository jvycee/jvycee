# Hi, I'm Jaycee ðŸ‘‹

## Frontend Developer and p5.js fan


I love solving hard problems. My other focus is developing my writing and clear thinking skills. The sweet spot for me is clearly explaining a technical answer in clear natural language.  

My 2022 goals:
- write clean code
- ship work before it's perfect
- share my art
- connect with other p5.js coders and developers
